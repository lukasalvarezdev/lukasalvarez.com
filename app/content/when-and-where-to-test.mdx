Writing tests is a fundamental practice in modern software development, but it's easy to fall
into the trap of over-testing. Striking the right balance between test coverage and code
maintenance is crucial. This post will guide you on when and where to write tests effectively,
ensuring they serve their primary purpose: to give you confidence at deploy time.

### The Purpose of Writing Tests

The main goal of writing tests is to ensure that your code works as expected and to catch
potential issues before they reach production. Tests should provide confidence that your
application behaves correctly, especially in critical paths or areas prone to changes. Remember,
writing tests is not about pleasing management or achieving high coverage percentages—it's about
maintaining software quality and reliability.

### When to Write Tests

- **Critical Code Paths:** Write tests for code that is central to your application's
  functionality. If this code fails, it will significantly impact users.

- **Frequently Changing Code:** Areas of your application that are frequently modified are good
  candidates for testing. Tests will help ensure that changes do not introduce new bugs.

- **Complex Logic:** If a function or module has complex logic, write tests to cover different
  scenarios. This will help ensure that edge cases are handled correctly.

- **Bug Fixes:** Whenever you fix a bug, add a test that would have caught the bug. This
  prevents the issue from resurfacing in the future.

### Where to Write Tests

1.  **Unit Tests:** Especially useful for functions with complex logic and multiple branches.
    Unit tests are ideal if your code is designed to be easily testable (see this blog post for
    more on writing testable code). They provide high confidence in the correctness of your
    logic. However, they won't catch issues related to how different parts of your application
    interact. For that, you'll need integration tests.

        ```ts showLineNumbers
        function calculateDiscountedPrice(price: number, discount: number): number {
        	return price - price * (discount / 100);
        }

        test('should calculate discounted price correctly', () => {
        	expect(calculateDiscountedPrice(100, 10)).toBe(90);
        	expect(calculateDiscountedPrice(200, 25)).toBe(150);
        });
        ```

2.  **Integration Tests:** These tests strike a good balance between being not too specific in
    implementation and still being lighter than end-to-end tests. Write integration tests for
    parts of the app or components used in multiple places or by different users. This approach
    helps ensure that edge cases are handled and that your code is not misused.

        ```ts showLineNumbers
        import { registerUser } from './userService';
        import { sendConfirmationEmail } from './emailService';

        jest.mock('./emailService'); // Mock email service

        test('should register user and send confirmation email', async () => {
        	const userData = { name: 'John Doe', email: 'john@example.com' };
        	await registerUser(userData);

        	// Verify that the confirmation email is sent
        	expect(sendConfirmationEmail).toHaveBeenCalledWith(userData.email);
        });
        ```

3.  **End-to-End Tests:** These provide the highest level of confidence by simulating real user
    interactions with your application. End-to-end tests should focus on black-box
    testing—testing the app as a user would, without delving into implementation details. While
    they offer the most comprehensive coverage, they can be slow, so it's best to use them for
    testing the happy path.

        ```ts showLineNumbers
        describe('User login flow', () => {
        	// Avoid using input names or ids. Only use what is visible to the user
        	it('should allow users to log in', async () => {
        		await page.goto('/login');
        		await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: /email/i }).fill(faker.email());
        		await page.getByRole('textbox', { name: /password/i }).fill(faker.password());
        		await page.getByRole('button', { name: /log in/i }).click()

        		await expect(page.getByText('Welcome')).toBeVisible();
        	});
        });
        ```

### Avoid Over-Testing

It's essential to avoid over-testing. Writing too many tests for trivial code or testing
implementation details can lead to increased maintenance overhead. Focus on tests that provide
real value and ensure your codebase remains manageable.

### Conclusion

Testing is a critical part of the development process, but it should be done thoughtfully. Write
tests where they matter most: critical paths, frequently changing code, and complex logic. Avoid
over-testing to keep your codebase clean and maintainable.

Remember, these guidelines are not hard and fast rules. Over time, you'll develop an internal
instinct for when and where to write tests based on your project's needs and your experiences.
The key is to ensure that your tests provide value and give you confidence in your code, without
becoming a burden.
