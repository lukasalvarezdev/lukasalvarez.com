# Software as an art and engineering

Writing software is often compared to art. Just as a sculptor refines details so their creation
is compelling up close and from afar, your code should be valuable not only to users but also to
fellow developers, do not be a pain to work with!. However, beyond the artistry, software must
also be treated as engineering. Much like civil engineers cannot afford mistakes when building a
bridge due to potential collapse, we must approach software development with the same precision,
care, and attention to detail—qualities that are frequently overlooked.

### The Importance of Details

In civil engineering, attention to detail can mean the difference between a safe structure and a
disaster. In software, the consequences might not be as immediate or visible, but over time,
they add up. A small mistake—a poorly designed function, a hardcoded value, or an overlooked
edge case—can spiral into larger issues. Often, we move too fast, eager to ship features or hit
deadlines, and this is where pragmatism plays a key role.

Being pragmatic isn’t about perfection. It’s about knowing when to prioritize speed and when to
slow down for precision. Sometimes, this means cutting scope. Other times, it means taking a bit
more time to think through a solution.

### Line Coverage vs Use-Case Coverage

A common mistake is relying solely on line coverage to measure test effectiveness, often a
requirement from management. To exceed mere compliance and meet your own standards as a
"craftsman," aim beyond what’s asked. Line coverage shows how many lines of code tests have
executed but doesn’t guarantee the code handles all real-world scenarios. For example, consider
a function that manages withdrawals from a bank account:

```ts showLineNumbers
type Account = { balance: number };

function withdraw(amount: number, account: Account): string {
	if (amount <= 0) {
		return 'Invalid withdrawal amount';
	}

	if (account.balance >= amount) {
		account.balance -= amount;
		return 'Withdrawal successful';
	}

	return 'Insufficient funds';
}
```

You might write tests to cover all lines of this function:

```ts showLineNumbers
describe('withdraw', () => {
	it('withdraws the correct amount when balance is sufficient', () => {
		const account: Account = { balance: 100 };
		const result = withdraw(50, account);
		expect(result).toBe('Withdrawal successful');
		expect(account.balance).toBe(50);
	});

	it('returns error for insufficient funds', () => {
		const account: Account = { balance: 50 };
		const result = withdraw(100, account);
		expect(result).toBe('Insufficient funds');
		expect(account.balance).toBe(50);
	});

	it('returns error for invalid withdrawal amount', () => {
		const account: Account = { balance: 100 };
		const result = withdraw(-10, account);
		expect(result).toBe('Invalid withdrawal amount');
	});
});
```

This provides 100% line coverage—now our manager is happy! But our inner craftsman? Not so much.
Sure, the function is covered, but what about real-world scenarios? For instance, what if the
withdrawal amount matches the exact balance?

```ts showLineNumbers
it('allows full balance withdrawal', () => {
	const account: Account = { balance: 50 };
	const result = withdraw(50, account);
	expect(result).toBe('Withdrawal successful');
	expect(account.balance).toBe(0);
});
```

This test passes, but what if there's a floating-point error or an edge case where the balance
could drop below zero? The coverage might be high, but it doesn’t address all potential issues.

### Improving with Use-Case Coverage

Instead of focusing solely on line coverage, aim for use-case coverage by considering real-world
scenarios, including edge cases. For instance, let's add a test case for the edge case where a
withdrawal amount slightly exceeds the balance:

```ts showLineNumbers
it('prevents the account from going negative', () => {
	const account: Account = { balance: 50 };
	const result = withdraw(50.01, account);
	expect(result).toBe('Insufficient funds');
	expect(account.balance).toBe(50);
});
```

This test ensures that the account never drops below zero, addressing a critical use case that
wasn't covered by line coverage alone.

### Code Duplication vs. Abstraction

Another area where pragmatism is important is in code duplication and abstraction. It’s easy to
jump into refactoring code too early, abstracting away functions to make everything look
“clean.” But sometimes, a little duplication is better than an unnecessary abstraction.

Consider this:

```ts showLineNumbers
function createUser(email: string) {
	// Create user logic
}

function createAdminUser(email: string) {
	// Create admin-specific logic
	createUser(email);
}
```

At first glance, you might think the createUser function is reusable, but is it? If createUser
evolves later on, and we make changes specific to general users, it could impact createAdminUser
in unexpected ways. In cases like this, duplicating some code might actually reduce complexity
and make your application easier to maintain. Not everything needs to be abstracted.

### Consistency and Tools

One of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is the value of consistency. Code should always look
clean and organized, but without obsessing over every little thing. The secret here is to use
tools that enforce consistency for you, like linters, formatters, and CI pipelines. These tools
eliminate human error in small, tedious tasks and let you focus on what really matters—writing
great code.

For example, using a linter:

```json showLineNumbers
{
	"extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended"],
	"rules": {
		"no-unused-vars": "error",
		"no-console": "warn",
		"@typescript-eslint/explicit-function-return-type": "off"
	}
}
```

This ensures that code remains tidy and clean without requiring manual enforcement. And by
automating things like code formatting with Prettier, you never have to worry about minor
inconsistencies like spacing or semicolons:

```json showLineNumbers
{
	"printWidth": 96,
	"tabWidth": 2,
	"useTabs": true,
	"semi": true,
	"singleQuote": true,
	"trailingComma": "all",
	"bracketSpacing": true,
	"arrowParens": "avoid",
	"proseWrap": "always"
}
```

By setting up these tools early in a project, you save time down the line. Developers won’t have
to debate formatting rules, and you can focus on more significant architectural decisions.

### The Role of Pragmatism

Ultimately, software engineering is a balance between speed, precision, and pragmatism. Knowing
when to spend time on details and when to move forward is key. Without pragmatism, you risk
over-engineering, adding complexity where it’s not needed, and wasting time on issues that won’t
significantly impact the project.

But being pragmatic doesn’t mean cutting corners. It’s about making informed decisions that fit
the current needs of the project while keeping an eye on the future. When you focus too much on
shortcuts, technical debt builds up, and eventually, it can sink your project. On the other
hand, over-engineering every aspect can slow you down and hinder progress. Pragmatism lies
somewhere in between.

### Software as a Garden

In the end, software development is like a garden—it requires constant care, attention, and
pruning. You need to watch it grow, remove weeds, and nourish it with best practices,
automation, and careful thought. If left unattended, it becomes unmaintainable and chaotic. If
over-pruned, it becomes fragile. Finding the right balance is an ongoing process.

The code you write should be robust enough to last and flexible enough to evolve. By being
pragmatic, paying attention to the details, and focusing on consistency, you ensure that your
code can stand the test of time—just like a well-tended garden.
